The Machine Learning, Optimization and Data (MOD) Lab at Marquette University  is led by Dr. Nasim Yahyasoltani and conducts research on algorithms, analysis, and application of machine learning, optimization and statistical signal processing. With a focus on data science, network science, and intelligent systems, current research interests include the following:

- Online machine learning and time-varying optimization for real-time control and decisions 
- Graph signal processing/machine learning and network data analytics 
- Robust machine learning  
- Privacy-aware machine learning 
- Stochastic and chance-constrained optimization  
- Federated learning and distributed optimization
